<strong>WHO I AM</strong> <br>
Hello, and welcome to my page! I’m Tom, a software developer here in Silicon Valley. For me, software development has always been the itch I couldn’t scratch—I just can’t get enough. Nothing tickles my fancy more than tinkering with new technologies, and seeing how I can incorporate new tech into my own personal projects. After working in the education industry for six years, I’m turning to a career in development to explore how technologies run in corporate settings. If you ask me, the only thing more fun than exploring tech on my own is exploring tech on a team!
<br>

<strong>WHAT I'VE DONE</strong> <br>
After studying Mandarin Chinese in college, my professional career began as a special education teacher in Teach For America. Over the next 6 years I spent time in both public and private schools, working my way to become the principal of a private school, and eventually landing at a robotics startup company. It was during my time at the robotics startup that my interest in coding blossomed into a full blown obsession. Tinkering on codecademy wasn’t enough to satiate my appetite for the world of development; it was time to start a career in tech!

<strong>HOW I CAN BENEFIT A COMPANY</strong> <br>
Over the course of my background I’ve developed skills that I’m eager to contribute to a company. Here’s what makes me unique: <br>
<br>
<strong>I'm Bilingual</strong>: I can’t imagine life without Chinese. After 13 years studying the language, Chinese and I are joined at the hip. Am I fluent in the language? To be honest, I wouldn’t even say I’m fluent in English; but after two degrees and a Fulbright, I can say my Mandarin is fairly 不错! <br>
<br>
<strong>I Love Public Speaking</strong>: A side effect of studying Chinese is its extermination of public speaking anxiety. As a kid, I was as nervous to get in front of a group of people as most, this changed in 2013 when I spent the summer in Beijing speaking Mandarin at professional conferences in front of native Chinese speakers. Let me tell you, any lingering public speaking anxiety died that summer! Since then, I find myself quick to volunteer for presentations, videos, conferences, etc.. The robotics company I worked for offered plenty of opportunities to utilize this skill, and I’m hopeful I’ll have a chance to continue using as a developer. <br>
<br>
<strong>I've Had a Wide Range of Experience</strong>: While working in education, I spent time as a green first-year teacher, a seasoned principal, and everywhere in between. This wide range of managerial levels taught me quite a bit about communication, collaborating with colleagues, and taking responsibility for results. Thanks to this range of experience I have the confidence to enter my new career and produce at any level. <br>
<br>
<strong>I'm Passionate About Coding</strong>: Software development is near and dear to my heart. They say if you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life; the thought of spending each day working with technologies around other who share my passion seems too good to be true. If you're a company looking for an energetic developer with a fervor for the field, and zeal for improving his skill set—I’m your guy!
