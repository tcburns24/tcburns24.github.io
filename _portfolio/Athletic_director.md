## What Is It?

A relatively straightforward CRUD app deseigned for athletic directors to manage the student-athletes at their college or university. Add, update, and delete functionalities on full display.

## What's In It?

• Database: PostgreSQL (hosted by our friends at Neon)
• Backend: NodeJS
• Frontend: AngularJS

## How'd I Build it?

First I designed the database schema (that took a few revisions). The schema involves 2 tables ("athletes" and "sports") connected via a foreign key. Then I built out the API endpoints in Node, and finally added a nifty, modern UI with Angular.

Code on, my friends!
