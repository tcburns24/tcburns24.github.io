## What Is It?

Take on the villains of Gotham city at the blackjack table. I built this full-stack app with Google Firebase handling the backend and database, and Flutter handling the UI. Cross-platform so it's available in web, Android, and iOS.

## What's In It?

• <strong>Database & Backend:</strong> Google Firebase <br />
• <strong>Frontend:</strong> Flutter
