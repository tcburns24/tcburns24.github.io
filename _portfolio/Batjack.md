## What Is It?

Take on the villains of Gotham city at the blackjack table. I built this full-stack app with Google Firebase handling the backend and database, and Flutter handling the UI. Cross-platform so it's available in web, Android, and iOS.

## What's In It?

• Database & Backend: Google Firebse
• Frontend: Flutter
