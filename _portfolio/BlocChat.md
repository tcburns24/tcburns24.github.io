## Explanation
Bloc Chat has been a great introduction into Google's Firebase platform. Since I enrolled at Bloc, I quickly discovered that there is no finish line in studying software development; the scope of development is so large, you can spend a lifetime learning new skills, sampling new platforms, but still not see it all. With that in mind, exposure is key! Tinkering with Firebase was fun, especially after learning Rails in Bloc's Backend course. Comparing and contrasting databases is a learning experience in itself.

I could see myself using Firebase again in the future — it's user-friendly and efficient. I hope you enjoy chatting on Bloc Chat!

Chat on, my friends!
